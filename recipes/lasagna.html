    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.
